Description: Variational inference for a sparse multivariate regression model
    that allows combined selection of covariates and associated responses in
    high-dimensional set-ups (Helene Ruffieux, Anthony C. Davison, Jorg Hager,
    Irina Irincheeva, 2016, arXiv:1609.03400). This software used on genetic data
    from molecular quantitative trait locus (QTL) problems with over 200K single
    nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), hundreds of molecular expression levels and
    hundreds of individuals.
