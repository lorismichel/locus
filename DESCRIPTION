Description: Variational inference for a sparse multivariate regression model
    that allows combined selection of covariates and associated responses in
    high-dimensional set-ups (Helene Ruffieux, Anthony C. Davison, Jorg Hager,
    Irina Irincheeva, 2017, Biostatistics). This software used on genetic data
    from molecular quantitative trait locus (QTL) problems with over 200K single
    nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), hundreds of molecular expression levels and
    hundreds of individuals.
